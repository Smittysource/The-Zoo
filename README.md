This C++ project is a demonstration of coding ability using vectors, pointers, base and sub classes, and combining a C++ program with a Java class.
The project was designed to develop an editable list of tracking numbers and zoo animals to allow for removing animals and changing tracking numbers. This functionality was not originally available to the client.
I feel that the input validation and pointer creation and deletion were handled well.
Having more time to work on this, I would have tried to move more of the code from the main C++ file into the C++ classes. This would have cut down some clutter in TheZoo.cpp and possibly combined some code that didn't need to be repeated.
Learning about subclasses and pointers to the base class while trying to actually write the code caused a few rewritings of how things were done. Avoiding slicing off methods would have been a lot easier if I had known about it starting the project. However, adding these things that I learned working on this project to my abilities in coding will be very beneficial in future coding and coursework.
There are comments throughout the project to help anyone who examines this code later (including myself) how each part was done. Constants were used where appropriate to help when updating the code in the future.
